# Vinicius Valentim Pereira

I'm an begginer developer looking to improve my technical and interpersonal skills. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Sorocaba (UNISO).
My first contact with programming was as a teenager, in a game development class, where I learned to program with blocks. Later, I was introduced to Python and then JavaScript. My interest in technology deepened during the technical course in Mechatronics, from which I graduated in 2021 and continues to this day.
In my free time I like to play sports, go to the gym and listen to or play music.
I am currently looking for an internship in Backend development, or a junior position where I can apply my academic background, gain practical experience and contribute to innovative technology projects. I am motivated to learn, evolve and add value in a dynamic and challenging environment.
